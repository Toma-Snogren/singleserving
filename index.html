   <h2>Castle Island</h2>
   <p>A visit to Castle Island combines history and recreation. Tour Fort Independence or take a walk around it. Continue the day sunbathing or swimming at one of the nearby beaches.</p>
   <p>Castle Island is a peninsula in South Boston on the shore of Boston Harbor. In 1928, Castle Island was connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land and is thus no longer an island. It has been the site of a fortification since 1634, and is currently a 22-acre (8.9 ha) recreation site and the location of Fort Independence.</p>

   <h2>Old Silver Beach</h2>
   <p>Two sections: One for residents who have beach stickers and another for the general public. Each section has its own parking area. Large beach. Calm, warm water. Strong currents at high tide.
Popular Old Silver Beach lies on the western shores of Falmouth and offers a spectacular view of Buzzards Bay. Though large, this beach gets crowded early. It is split into two sections, each with its own parking lot. One side is for only residents who have beach stickers, the other for the general public. The beaches are separated by a small rock jetty and both are equally nice. Old Silver Beach with its warm waters from Buzzards Bay is as popular as it is beautiful.</p>
